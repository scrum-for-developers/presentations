### Why should we do Acceptance Testing? <!-- .element: class="heading" -->

---

### Communication Problems

* Requirements are misunderstood
* Obvious things are not obvious
* Wrong assumptions<p/>
* Specification
  * does not reflect implementation
  * has gaps and is inconsistent<p/>
* The most important information in the business specification is ...

### Fail fast

* Requirements are not met every time
* Gain feedback as fast as possible
* Not met requirements or bugs should be discovered **before** a feature comes into production!

## What if?

<!-- tests are specified in business domain terms -->
* PO && Devs could share the same understanding?

* PO && Devs could define their specification beforehand and adapt it in code?

* Devs could reduce explorational testing by automated tests?

## Executable Specification

* **Given**: Is a pre-conditioned state <p>
<font color="blue">I have Kevin added as Facebook friend</font>

* **When**: An actor interacts with the system <p>
<font color="blue">I visit Kevin's Facebook profile and click the 'Remove from Friends' button</font>

* **Then**: I have a measurable outcome<p>
<font color="blue">I don't find him in my friends list anymore</font>

* Gherkin Syntax

---

### Executable Specifications<br /> do reflect User Stories

* User Stories
  * Who? What? When?
  * Encourage discussion<p/>
* Executable Specification
  * Result of the discussion
  * Common understanding of all participants <br/>(PO, Dev, QA, ...)

---

### Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATTD)

* User Stories and Executable Specification
* Define an Executable Specification / Gherkin Scenario before you code
* Focus the software development on the "green" of the Acceptance Tests
