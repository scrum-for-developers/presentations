### Why should we do ATDD? <!-- .element: class="heading" -->

---

### Communication Problems

* Requirements are misunderstood
* Obvious things are not obvious
* Wrong assumptions
* Specification
  * does not reflect implementation
  * has gaps and is inconsistent
* The most important information in the business specification is ...

### Fail fast

* Requirements are not met every time
* Gain feedback as fast as possible
* Not met requirements or bugs should be discovered **before** a feature comes into production!

## What if ... ?

<!-- tests are specified in business domain terms -->
* PO && Devs would speak the same language?

* PO could define his specification beforehand - in code!?

* Devs could reduce explorational testing by automated tests?

### How can we get there? <!-- .element: class="heading" -->

### Agile Acceptance Testing

* Use real examples to build a common understanding and vocabular (DDD: "ubiquitous language")
* Choose a set of these examples for the specification and their acceptance tests
* Automate the verification of the acceptance tests
* Focus the software development on the "green" of the acceptance tests
* Use the set of acceptance tests to discuss future change requests

---

### What executable specifications are NOT

* No scripts
  * But Rules
* Do not **replace** exploratory testing
  * But allows you to invest more time into testing corner cases
* No UI Tests

---

### User stories and executable specification work hand in hand

* User Stories
  * Who? What? When?
  * Encourage discussion
* Executable specification
  * Result of the discussion
  * Common understanding of all participants (PO, Dev, QA, ...)
