# codecentric scrum for developers presentation

Built with reveal.js

This is still work in progress.

What I want to do is rebuild the scrum for developers presentation with reveal.js.

Available at [Github Pages](https://scrum-for-developers.github.io/presentations/)

## Installation instructions

To look at it, just open the index.html.

~~To build it you need node installed. Then run (in a presentation folder):
console
npm install
grunt serve~~

Forget that, it worked when I built the project but I did not write down
the npm version. With future versions there are conflicts. So just run a
python http server:

* With Python2:
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
* With Python3:
`python -m http.server`
