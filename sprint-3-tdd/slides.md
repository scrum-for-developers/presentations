### The three rules of TDD

- You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
- You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
- You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

### Example Story

As a library manager I want a fee to be charged for a rented book after a given
time, so that the borrowers don't keep the books for too long.

Acceptance criteria:

* Until four weeks (28 days) --> 0 €
* In the fith week (29 - 35 days) --> 1€
* Every week after that (>=36 days) --> (1€) + 2€ for every additional week
